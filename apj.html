        <b><p class="year">1931-2015</p>
        <h1 class="simple">Missile Man Of India</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. His scientific achievements and popularity gained him the epithets “Missile Man” and “People’s President.”

          Early life and career
          Kalam was born in a town in Tamil Nadu state to a fishing boat owner from a once wealthy family. The youngest of five siblings, Kalam persevered with his education despite his impoverished circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. In 1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space program to the international stage. Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle technologies at ISRO, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
          
          Missile program
          Having rejoined DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, which produced a number of successful missiles. Among them was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III; it was first launched in 1989. Another success was the surface-to-surface tactical missile Prithvi.</p>
